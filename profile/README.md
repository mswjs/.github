[Mock Service Worker](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) is an API mocking library for browser and Node.js that uses a Service Worker to intercept requests that actually happened. This means no request client stubs and unmatched resilience when it comes to request integrity, as your app now performs requests the same way it does in production.

## Ecosystem

We favor composition in both how we write our code and how we distribute it. That's why instead of building a single monolithic package that's responsible for too many things, we distribute the [core module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw) with the essentials that everybody could use, and provide a set of standalone _extensions_ that enable specific workflows and push the developer experience even further.

### Native extensions

| Package                                                            | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [@mswjs/data](https://github.com/mswjs/data)                       | Model and query your mock data (fixtures).       |
| [@mswjs/http-middleware](https://github.com/mswjs/http-middleware) | Spawn an HTTP server from your request handlers. |

### Third-party extensions

| Package                                                             | Description                                                       |
